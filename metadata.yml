title: A Decentralized Protocol for Remunerating the Open‑Source Ecosystem
abstract: |-
  Creating an open, public and stable registry for all open-source software
  would empower projects to publish releases independently rather than rely on
  third parties who assemble this irregular data into hundreds of separate
  (and duplicated) systems. Package maintainers will publish their releases to
  a decentralized registry powered by a Byzantine fault-tolerant blockchain to
  eliminate single sources of failure, provide immutable releases, and allow
  communities to govern their regions of the open-source ecosystem,
  independent of external agendas.

  tea incentivizes the maintenance of open-source by allowing network
  participants to stake value against the packages they depend on and want to
  secure. The tea protocol’s graph provides immutable package registration,
  dependency requirements, package authenticity, and usage oracles to inform
  the tea remuneration algorithm. Systematic inflation is distributed to all
  packages based on that algorithm. If security or development issues are
  found, developers can make claims supported by evidence against the package,
  and slashing may occur. Members of the open-source community can review
  packages for quality issues, and the protocol can respond to these reviews
  by enacting proportional slashing events.
